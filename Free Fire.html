            EVOS Divine (formerly EVOS Capital) is an Indonesian Free Fire team under EVOS Esports, a Southeast Asia gaming multi-organization based in Indonesia

History
EVOS Esports was founded and operated by Ivan "ToxiCEO" Yeo, Wesley Yiu, Michael "Mike" Wijaya, and Hartman Harris. The organization started in 2016 as a newly formed Dota 2 team. The team has achieved many title wins and successful title defenses, earning great respect and success in a very short span of time. As time passed, the Dota 2 and Point Blank teams were disbanded and newer divisions start to appear in different games such as Mobile Legends, Free Fire, and PUBG Mobile.

2019 was the culmination of EVOS Esports' glory because they won a global-scale tournament in 2 different titles - that is the Free Fire division which managed to win the Free Fire World Cup 2019 in Thailand Bangkok, and the Mobile Legends division which won the M1 World Championship 2019 in Malaysia Kuala Lumpur.

In April 2019, they entered Free Fire by acquiring Capital Esports's roster and became EVOS Capital.
In December 2019, team rebranded to EVOS Esports.
